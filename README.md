# Negative-Hard-Mining-For-Cross-Domain-Image-matching
The NegativeMining.ipynb contains the 5 step architecture for running different negative hard mining strategies on the Cross-Eyed Periocular image dataset.

The ResNet_featureExtraction.ipynb file is used to derive features for the cross-eyed dataset images.

## ImageNet Metric Learning
We have tried basic triplet loss function without any negative hard mining strategy in the ImageNet_triplet.ipynb file.
